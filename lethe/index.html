                        Modern data systems are required to process an enormous
                        amount of data generated by a variety of applications.
                        To support this requirement, modern data stores reduce
                        read/write interference by employing the out-of-place
                        paradigm. The classical out-of-place design is the
                        log-structured merge (LSM) tree. LSM-trees write the 
                        incoming key-value entries in an in-memory buffer to 
                        ensure high write throughput, and uses in-memory 
                        auxiliary data structures (such as Bloom filters 
                        and fence pointers) to provide competitive read 
                        performance. While LSMs are great for writes and 
                        reads in general, we show that <i>all state-of-the-art 
                        LSM-based data stores perform suboptimally in presence 
                        deletes in a workload</i>.

                        <h3>Deletes in LSM-trees</h3>
                        <!-- <br> -->
                        <p> Deletes in LSM-trees are realized <i>logically</i> 
                        by inserting a special type of key-value entry, known 
                        as a tombstone. Once inserted, a tombstone logically
                        invalidates all entries in a tree that has a matching 
                        key, without necessarily disturbing the physical target 
                        data entries. The target entries are persistently 
                        deleted from the data store only after the corresponding 
                        tombstone reaches the last level of the tree through 
                        compactions. The time taken to persistently delete the 
                        target entries depends on (i) the file picking 
                        policy followed by the compaction routine, (ii) the 
                        rate of ingestion of entries to the database, 
                        (iii) the size ratio of the LSM-tree, and (iv) the 
                        number of levels in the tree.

                        The figure above shows how tombstone-driven logical
                        deletes <i>eventually</i> becomes persistent using 
                        an example where we want to delete all entries with 
                        key 6 from an LSM-based data store. 
                        In Step 1, a tombstone for 6, denoted by 
                        6<sup>*</sup>, is inserted into the tree. Step 2, 
                        shows how the file containing the tombstone 
                        6<sup>*</sup> moves to the next level of the tree 
                        due to (partial) compaction. Finally, Step 3 shows 
                        how all entries with a matching key are eventually 
                        persistently removed from the LSM-tree after the

                    <h3>Primary deletes: Deletes on sort-key</h3>
                    <p> As discussed, deletes on the 
                        sort-key, i.e., the "key" of the 
                        key-value entries, is realized by inserting 
                        tombstones against the to-be-deleted key. 
                        The problems with this are the following. 
                        First, retaining the invalidated entries 
                        (along with the tombstones) in the tree 
                        leads to mis-utilization of disk space, 
                        which causes <b>space amplification</b>. 
                        Second, the invalidated entries in the tree 
                        are re-written over and over again during 
                        compaction which causes <b>write amplification</b>. 
                        Third, as the invalidated entries (and the 
                        tombstones) remain hashed into the Bloom 
                        filters, for a fixed memory budget, 
                        they increase the false positive rate 
                        of the filter, which results in asymptotically
                        <b>poorer read performance</b>. Finally, as 
                        there is no bound on the time taken to 
                        persistently delete the data objects,  
                        out-of-place deletes may lead to very high 
                        latency for persistent deletes, which is 
                        a serious <b>privacy concern</b>.

                    <p> Deletes on an attribute that is different from the sort key
                        are referred to as secondary deletes. Secondary range 
                        delete operations, that delete a range of entries based 
                        on a secondary attribute, are also frequent in several

                        practical workloads. Modern LSM-based 
                        data stores are unable to realize secondary range deletes
                        efficiently, as the entries qualifying for such an operation 
                        may be scattered all across the tree. The way commercial 
                        data stores realize secondary range delete operations is by 
                        periodically (typically, every 7, 15, or 30 days) 
                        compacting the whole tree to a single base level. Such full 
                        tree compactions are highly undesirable as they require 
                        many superfluous I/Os to the disk and may also 
                        lead to prolonged write stalls and latency spikes. 
                        In the example here, we use S to denote the sort key and D for
                        the delete key, and we observe that to realize a secondary 
                        range delete operation that deletes all entries with a 
                        timestamp smaller than 66, all four pages shown, must be read to 
                        memory.

                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <p> To achieve the first design goal, we introduce FADE,
                        a family of delete-aware compaction strategies that
                        ensures that all tombstones are persisted within a
                        delete persistence threshold. FADE uses additional
                        information about the age of the tombstones 
                        contained in a file and
                        the estimated invalidated entries per tombstone to 
                        ensure that all tombstones in an LSM-tree are 
                        persisted within the user/application-set 
                        threshold. FADE achieves this by using the delete 
                        persistence threshold to 
                        assign a time-to-live for every level of a tree. 
                        Now, if at any point, the age of a file containing a tombstone 
                        exceeds the level-TTL, FADE initiates a compaction.

                    <p> Note that, this compaction trigger is completely orthogonal 
                        to the saturation-based trigger, and is driven 
                        by the <i>age of the oldest tombstone contained in a 
                        file</i>. This way, FADE ensures timely delete 
                        persistence, and by removing the invalidated entries 
                        timely and persistently from the tree, FADE also 
                        improves the overall performance of the storage 
                        engine in presence of deletes. The figure above shows 
                        step-wise how FADE guarantees timely delete persistence 
                        by setting earlier deadlines for future compaction jobs.

                <p> To facilitate the second design goal concerning 
                    secondary range deletes, we introduce KiWi, a
                    continuum of physical storage layouts the arranges the data on disk
                    in an interweaved sorted order on the sort key and delete key. 
                    KiWi supports secondary range deletes without performing a full-tree
                    compaction, at the cost of minimal extra metadata and a tunable
                    penalty on read performance.

                    <br>
                    <p> KiWi adds one new layer in the storage layout of LSM trees.
                    In particular, in addition to the levels of the tree, the files
                    of a level, and the pages of a file, we now introduce delete
                    tiles that belong to a file and consist of pages. 
                    A delete tile is a logical collection of consecutive pages in 
                    a file. Within a delete tile, the entries are partitioned on the 
                    delete key, D and are split into pages. This way, by ordering 
                    the entries on D allows KiWi to cluster the qualifying entries for 
                    secondary range deletes. This, in turn, allows KiWi to perform 
                    secondary range deletes at the cost of fewer disk I/Os. To 
                    facilitate tight binary search within a page during lookups, 
                    KiWi then re-sorts the entries on the sort key, S, as 
                    shown in the figure above.

                        Lethe puts together the benefits of FADE and KiWi to
                        better support deletes in LSM-trees. For a given workload
                        and a persistence delete latency threshold, Lethe offers
                        maximal performance, by carefully tuning the cost of
                        persistent deletes, and their impact on the overall
                        performance of the system. We evaluate Lethe against
                        state-of-the-art LSM-tree designs for a range of workloads
                        with deletes and different delete persistence

                    <p> For the following experiments, we insert 1GB data in
                        the database
                        (avg. entry size = 1KB). The size of
                        the memory buffer is 1MB and size ratio of the tree is
                        10. The delete persistence threshold is set to 16.67%,
                        25%, and 50% of the experiment's run-time.

                        Figure (A) shows that Lethe ensures timely persistent
                        deletion. Lethe persists
                        between 40% and 80% more tombstones as compared 
                        to RocksDB, and it does so while
                        honoring the delete persistence threshold. Figure (B)
                        shows that Lethe significantly reduces space
                        amplification by persisting deletes timely. Figure (C)
                        shows that Lethe offers improved read performance as
                        compared to RocksDB by purging invalidated 
                        entries in a time-bound manner, and

                        Figure (D) shows that, a higher delete tile granularity
                        increases the number of full page drops, thus reducing
                        I/O when data is stored in KiWi. Figure (E) shows that
                        different delete tile granularity is optimal for
                        different workloads. Lethe can navigate the
                        continuum of storage layout and offer superior overall
                        performance by determining the optimal storage layout.
                        Figure (F) shows the total time spent in hashing and
                        I/O access for both Lethe and RocksDB while varying
                        delete tile size. Lethe computes the optimal value of
                        h, which in this case is 8. For h = 8, the I/O cost for
                        Lethe is 76% lower than that in RocksDB. This comes at
                        the price of a 5x increase in the hashing cost, which
                        however, is completely hidden behind the massive benefits in
                        total number of I/Os.

                            State-of-the-art LSM-based key-value stores perform
                            suboptimally for workloads with even a small
                            proportion of deletes, and that the delete
                            persistence latency in these data stores are
                            potentially unbounded. To address this, we build
                            Lethe, a new LSM-based engine that introduces a new
                            family of compaction strategies FADE and KiWi, a
                            continuum of physical data storage layouts. FADE
                            enforces delete persistence within a user-defined
                            threshold while increasing read throughput and
                            reducing space amplification, at the expense of a
                            modest increase in write amplification. KiWi offers
                            efficient secondary range deletes, which can be
                            tuned to outperform state of the art for a given
                            workload. Lethe is the first LSM-based storage
                            engine to our knowledge that offers efficient
                            deletes with no or positive interference with read
                            performance, supports user-defined delete latency
                            thresholds, and enables practical secondary range
                            deletes.
